# About
S.V.E.T.T stands for Scientific Vacation Electronic Temperature Taker
The program is intended for use on cabins with thermostate based heating. 
If the temperature goes above or below the set limits the program will 
send an email and/or SMS via a connected cell-phone to all subscribers, 
and let them know that the thermostate control has failed.
The program was written in C# as part of a programming class 
for first year IA engineer studies on HiT (Norway). 
The program makes use of a temperature sensor from National Instruments 
for recording the current temperature.
