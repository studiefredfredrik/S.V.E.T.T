S.V.E.T.T stands for Scientific Vacation Electronic Temperature Taker

The program is intended for use on cabins with thermostate based heating. If the temperature goes above or below the set limits the program will send an email and/or SMS via a connected cell-phone to all subscribers, and let them know that the thermostate control has failed.

The program was written in C# as part of a programming class for first year IA engineer studies on HiT (Norway). The program makes use of a temperature sensor from National Instruments for recording the current temperature.
